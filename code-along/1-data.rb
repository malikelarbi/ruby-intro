# To run this code, be sure your current working directory
# is the same as where this file is located and then run:
# ruby 1-data.rb

# In Ruby, there are different *types* of data:

# Numbers
puts 3
puts 5

# Perform simple math with numbers
puts 5 + 2
puts 5 - 2
puts 5 * 2
puts 5 / 2

# Integers vs. Floats
puts 6 / 9.0

# Order of Operations
puts (2 + 5) * 5

# Strings
puts "Hello, world!"

# Combine strings together
puts "Tacos are " + "delish"
puts "tacos" * 3
puts "tacos" +3.to_s

# Variables
a = 10
b = 3
puts a * b

food = "tacos"
quantity = 3
puts food * quantity

# Combine strings and variables

first_name = "Boba"
greeting = "Hello " + first_name # string interpolation
puts greeting

puts "tacos #(3)"
puts "#{food} #{quantity}"

# String manipulation
puts "Hello".reverse
puts "Hello".length
